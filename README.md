# Auto-Web-Files-Sorter
After downloading web files from a website through your browser, you can then use this python application to sort your files based on file extensions (css, js, images). As an added bonus a new html file is generated with the paths changed for any files that were placed in new folders. New html file should be located in the same directory as the rest of the site's newly organized files.
